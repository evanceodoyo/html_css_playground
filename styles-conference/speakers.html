                    <h5>(You should be) testing your JavaScript</h5>
                    <p>JavaScript applications frequently utilize battle-tested libraries like jQuery, ReactJS, Vue.js
                        and more, but how can we be sure that our code is ready for production? This talk will share
                        tips on how writing tests can be written easily and quickly and how to remove buggy code through
                        testing.</p>

                    <p>Talk abstract: As our websites, applications and teams grow larger and more complicated, so does
                        our CSS. Before we know it, we find ourselves no longer with cute little stylesheets, but
                        sprawling, surly teenaged CSS that doesn&#8217;t always play nice with others. We need to learn
                        how to manage and optimize our CSS no matter how large the project or diverse the team. If we
                        start early, we can use best practices and tools to raise full-grown stylesheets any designer or
                        developer would be happy to work with.</p>
                    <h5>About Jen</h5>

                        creating focus around the problem we are trying to solve. They improve our consistency, which
                        provides a better experience for our users. And they help us grow, a valuable asset in times of
                        innovation.</p>
